== About

This repository contains a https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/[Kubernetes Operator]
for use with https://kubernetes.io/[Kubernetes] or https://www.openshift.com/[RedHat OpenShift Container Platform (OCP)].
The operator is built using the https://sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/install-operator-sdk/[Operator-SDK]
from RedHat, and can manage http://nginx.org/[NGINX] or https://www.nginx.com/[NGINX Plus] Load Balancers running
outside the container platform.

The Operator is designed to work with https://www.nginx.com/products/nginx-controller/[NGINX Controller] to
provide an Application Centric deployment model. The NGINX Controller provides a declarative API which is RBAC
enabled and enables you to link roles and environments to NGINX Instances ("Gateways").

Multiple environments and RBAC users can deploy to the same Gateways. The controller builds a best practice
NGINX configuration which incorporates all services and pushes it out to NGINX when configuration is changed.
This allows multiple "projects" or "namespaces" to deploy configuration to the same or different NGINX
instances.

=== How does it work?

The operator configures an external NGINX instance (via controller) to Load Balance onto a
https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/[Kubernetes Service].

If the service is configured with the NodePort ServiceType, then the external Load Balancer will
use the Kubernetes/OCP node IPs with the assigned port. If the ServiceType is not NodePort then
the configuration will try to reach the pods directly.

The Operator includes several https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/[Custom Resources]
which it watches for configuration. The CRs largely tie into the Controllers Application Centric View.
After deploying the operator it will start watching for these CRs.

There are currently 5 Custom Resources watched by the operator and it also watches `Deployment.apps`.

When a resource which is being watched is modifed a reconciliation process happens using the playbook specified in
the `watches.yaml` file. 

.CRDs
|===
| CRD | Description

| <<controller-crd,lb.nginx.com_controllers>>
| Controller Configuration, Includes FQDN, Auth details, and the Environment to use.

| <<application-crd,lb.nginx.com_applications>>
| The Application as represented in NGINX Controller

| <<gateway-crd,lb.nginx.com_gateways>>
| A Service gateway, The NGINX instances on which components will be deployed

| <<component-crd,lb.nginx.com_components>>
| The component is deployed into an Application on a Gateway

| <<certificate-crd,lb.nginx.com_certificates>>
| A TLS Certificate for use in a Gateway or Component
|===

The `Controller` needs to be configured first because it holds connection information for the NGINX Controller. This
includes the `user_email`, `fqdn`, `environment` and a reference to a `Secret` resource holding the `user_password`.

All of the other resources require a `Controller` resource. The `Application` and `Certificate` resources have no other
dependencies. The `Gateway` may require a `Certificate` if the service is using TLS, and the `Component` links all
other resources together to form the "Application Endpoint".

The Kubernetes `Service` which makes up the workgroup (`pool` or `upstream` if you prefer) should be named in the
`Component` resource under the `spec.ingress` setting.

=== Desired State

The controller uses a declarative API, and the configuration is supplied in a `desiredState` object.

You can suppply the `desiredState` in the `Gateway`,`Component`, and `Certificate` resources and that state will be
sent to the controller. With the following caveats:

* Gateway: The desiredState is used as is to create a new gateway object. The gateway will be called `namespace.name` in controller
* Certificate: The `desiredState` can be taken from the resource directly or merged with data from a kubernetes `Secret`. Any fields
  set in the optional `Secret` will take precedence over those given in `desiredState`.
* Component: The `desiredState` can enable any controller functionality, but the ingress gateway will be overwritten by a link to the
  `Gateway` set on the resource, and the backend workload group URIs list will be populated from the `Service` named in `spec.ingress`

=== Deployment Scaling

If you want the Operator to update the workgroups in your `Component` when your `Deployment` is scaled, then you should add a label
to the metadata called `nginx-lb-component` and set it to the name of the `Component` to be updated. Eg:

----
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: whatcheese-www
  namespace: ingress-dev
  labels:
    app: whatcheese-www
    nginx-lb-component: whatcheese-www
    ...

----

=== Usage with Ingress Controller

This operator can be used in conjunction with the https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-ingress-controller/[NGINX Ingress Controller]
to provide external load balancing onto an NGINX Ingress layer running inside your container platform.
This is recommended in large scale deployments because it keeps the bulk of the Application Deliver Controller (ADC)
functionality within the container platform and namespace/project. 

NGINX Ingress Controller provides several https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/[Custom Resources]
which enable many more advanced features beyond those included with standard Ingress objects or OCP Routes.
While it has become common for Load Balancers to extend Ingress using annotations, that method is error prone
and fragments the Ingress spec. Using NGINX Custom Resources instead of Ingress has the following advantages:

* NGINX Custom Resources are fully validated by the Kubernetes API
* VirtualServer, VirtualServerRoute, TransportServer, etc all RBAC enabled
* Routing can be based on anything within the request (header, cookie, method, etc)
* Blue/Green traffic splitting and Canary testing of application
* Circuit Breaker patterns
* Redirects and Error Pages

See the https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-ingress-controller/configuration/virtualserver-and-virtualserverroute-resources[Documentation]
for more information.

=== Usage without Ingress Controller

The Service should point to an NGINX Plus Ingress Controller (to provide additional ADC features), but it could also point to the
application directly.

== Setting Up and Building

You will need the https://sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/install-operator-sdk/[Operator-SDK] and
a recent version of https://www.docker.com/products/container-runtime[Docker] installed on your
build machine.

If you are playing around on a https://github.com/code-ready/crc[Codeready Containers] setup,
then follow <<docs/codereadynotes.adoc#,these notes>> instead.

=== Build the Operator 

build and push the operator to your repository

----
export IMAGE=myrepo.example.com:5000/nginx/nginx-lb-operator:latest
operator-sdk build $IMAGE
docker push $IMAGE
----

=== Install the CRDs

----
kubectl create -f deploy/crds/lb.nginx.com_controllers_crd.yaml
kubectl create -f deploy/crds/lb.nginx.com_applications_crd.yaml
kubectl create -f deploy/crds/lb.nginx.com_certificates_crd.yaml
kubectl create -f deploy/crds/lb.nginx.com_components_crd.yaml
kubectl create -f deploy/crds/lb.nginx.com_gateways_crd.yaml
----

****
You're ready to deploy the operator container, but you can also test it locally using the SDK.
See <<docs/runninglocally.adoc#,Running the Operator Locally>> if you want to test/debug.
****

== Deploy the Operator

The Operator is namespace-scoped, so each project needs to run it's own operator. 

We first need to setup the service account and role bindings for the Operator

----
kubectl create -f deploy/service_account.yaml
kubectl create -f deploy/role.yaml
kubectl create -f deploy/role_binding.yaml
----

Then replace the `REPLACE_IMAGE` placeholder in the Operator manifest with the actual
location and name of the image you built above, and deploy.

----
export IMAGE=myrepo.example.com:5000/nginx/nginx-lb-operator:latest
sed -e "s|REPLACE_IMAGE|${IMAGE}|g" deploy/operator.yaml > deploy/operator-for-reals.yaml
kubectl create -f deploy/operator-for-reals.yaml
----

That should be it. Your operator is running.

== The Operator Custom Resources

Below is an example for each of the Custom Resources which configure the Application.

=== Controller CRD

The `Controller` CRD take a user_email, FQDN, and Environment. It also needs a password stored in a Kubernetes `Secret`

Such as: 

[source,yaml]
----
kind: Secret
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: dev-controller
data:
  user_password: bm90cmVhbGx5bXlwYXNzd29yZAo=
type: Opaque
----

The Operator will use the `user_password` in the `Secret`, with the `user_email` in the `Controller` resource to log in and retrieve
an auth token. The auth token will be cached for 30 minutes, after which time the next reconciliation will perform a new login.

A `Controller` resource using the above secret would look like this:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: lb.nginx.com/v1alpha1
kind: Controller
metadata:
  name: dev-controller
spec:
  user_email: "admin@nginx.com"
  secret: "dev-controller"
  fqdn: "ctrl.nginx.lab"
  environment: "ocp-dev-1"
  validate_certs: true
----

The user account and the environment should already exist on the controller. All Applications, Gateways, Components, and Certificates
will reference a Controller resource by name and be deployed into the environment specified.

=== Application CRD

The Application is a simple object, but it groups the components and helps with analytics visualisation

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: lb.nginx.com/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: my-application
spec:
  controller: "dev-controller"
  displayName: "My Kubernetes Application"
  description: "An application deployed in Kubernetes"
----

=== Gateway CRD

The Gateways object takes a `desiredState` whch is sent to controller as is, so you can enable
any features exposed in the Controller API. Check your controller API for more information.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: lb.nginx.com/v1alpha1
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: my-gateway
spec:
  controller: "dev-controller"
  displayName: "My OCP Gateway"
  description: "A gateway deployed by Kubernetes"
  desiredState:
    ingress:
      placement:
        instancerefs:
          - ref: /infrastructure/locations/unspecified/instances/6
      uris:
        'http://www.uk.nginx.lab': {}
        'http://www.foo.com': {}
----

=== Component CRD

The Component object also takes a `desiredState`, but the operator expects to configure both the `ingress->gatewayRefs` 
using the `gateway` provided, and the `backend->workloadGroups->group` using the pods or NodePorts found in the `ingress`
setting. The workload `uris` are built using `workload.scheme` and `workload.path`

If the Ingress service is discovered to be using `NodePort`, then the workload groups will be set to the k8s nodes with
the dynamically assigned port. Otherwise the workloads will be set to the pod IP and the `workload.targetPort`

If you are using Codeready Containers The `workload.crcOverride` can be set to the IP of your CRC VM. You must set
Ingress services to use the `NodePort` type in this case.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: lb.nginx.com/v1alpha1
kind: Component
metadata:
  name: my-component
spec:
  controller: "dev-controller"
  application: "my-application"
  ingress: "my-nginx-ingress-controller"
  gateway: "my-gateway"
  workload:
    scheme: "http"
    path: "/"
    targetPort: 443
    crcOverride: 192.168.130.11
  displayName: "My Component"
  description: "A component deployed by Kubernetes"
  desiredState:
    backend:
      monitoring:
        response:
          status:
            match: true
            range:
              endCode: 302
              startCode: 200
        uri: /
      workloadGroups:
        # group uris will be populated from "ingress" pods or nodeports
        group:
          loadBalancingMethod:
            type: ROUND_ROBIN
    # ingress gatewayRefs will be populated from "gateway"
    ingress:
      uris:
        /: {}
----

The above would result in a `desiredState` similar to:

[source,json]
----
  "desiredState": {
    "ingress": {
      "gatewayRefs": [
        {
          "ref": "/services/environments/ocp-dev-1/gateways/<project>.my-gateway"
        }
      ],
      "uris": {
        "/": {}
      }
    },
    "backend": {
      "workloadGroups": {
        "group": {
          "loadBalancingMethod": {
            "type": "ROUND_ROBIN"
          },
          "uris": {
            "http://<k8s-node-ip>:<nodeport>/": { }
          }
        }
      },
      "monitoring": {
        "uri": "/",
        "response": {
          "status": {
            "range": {
              "endCode": 302,
              "startCode": 200
            },
            "match": true
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
----

=== Certificate CRD

The certificate Resource can be specified either by providing the details in the object directly
within the `desiredState` or by referencing a Kubernetes Secret in `secret`.

----
apiVersion: lb.nginx.com/v1alpha1
kind: Certificate
metadata:
  name: my-certificate
spec:
  controller: "dev-controller"
  displayName: "My Kubernetes Certificate"
  description: "A certificated deployed in Kubernetes"
  #secret: secret-containing-the-cert
  desiredState:
    type: PEM
    caCerts: []
    privateKey: |-
      -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----

      InWB8mhlndb/p8ZYVLx9y2LDq1h3iymbnoHM
      -----END CERTIFICATE-----
----

When referencing the cert as a kubernetes secret, then it should be an Opaque or tls type and
the certificate details should be stored in `tls.key` and `tls.crt`. 

----
kind: Secret
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: my-cert
data:
  tls.crt: >-
    LS0tLS1CRUdJTiBDRVJUSUZJQ0FURS0tLS0tCk1JSURwekNDQW8rZ0F3SUJBZ0lVYitOcXhISVAw

  type: UEVN
type: Opaque
----

and the Certificate would look like this

----
apiVersion: lb.nginx.com/v1alpha1
kind: Certificate
metadata:
  name: my-certificate
spec:
  controller: "dev-controller"
  displayName: "My Kubernetes Certificate"
  description: "A certificated deployed in Kubernetes"
  secret: my-cert
