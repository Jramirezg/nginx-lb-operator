== Setup

You need to have a `KUBECONFIG` setup for access to your kubernetes cluster, and the
Operator SDK installed. Then you need a few python modules.

To install with pip, run:

----
pip3 install ansible
pip3 install ansible-runner
pip3 install ansible-runner-http
pip3 install openshift
----

Check where PIP installs the binaries and ensure they are in your path.

----
pip3 show ansible
----

The `Location` will show the location of the packages. In my case ansible is installed
at `~/.local/lib/python3.5/site-packages`. So the binaries are in `~/.local/bin`.

== Get the Ansible Collections

----
ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml
----

== Run the Operator

----
operator-sdk run --local --watch-namespace <some-namespace> --ansible-verbosity 3
----
